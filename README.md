  # [LR11xx](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-edge) SPI command parser for [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com/)
  
## hookup
SPI pins required: SCLK, MISO, MOSI, nSS, and highly suggested to connect the interrupt DIO9 (or DIO11) pin and BUSY pin.  

As an extra addition, if you desire to know the operating mode time durations, you can simultaneously use the [LR11xx operating mode](https://github.com/dudmuck/lr11xx_mode) parser for Saleae.
